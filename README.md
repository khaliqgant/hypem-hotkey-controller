hypem-hotkey-controller [Download 1.3.1](http://bit.ly/1kEkXt7)
=======================

Control hypem.com via hotkeys using Alfred
* This will allow you to pause/play, skip a track, go to the previous, heart (like) a track on hypem.com, and see if you've liked the current track that is playing - which will display true or false
* This will not bring hypem.com to the forefront of your chrome browser, but will display a notification upon triggering.
* There are no default hotkeys set so you can go crazy setting your own
* This only supports Google Chrome currently, let me know if you want other browser support. 

* This is basically a port using [focusatwill-in-google-chrome](https://github.com/tangledhelix/focusatwill-in-google-chrome)
* You must allow in Chrome "Executing Javascript through Applescript": 
To turn it on, from the menu bar, go to View > Developer > Allow JavaScript from Apple Events
